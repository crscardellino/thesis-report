	Abstract = {Language is increasingly being used to define rich visual recognition problems with supporting image collections sourced from the web. Structured prediction models are used in these tasks to take advantage of correlations between co-occurring labels and visual input but risk inadvertently encoding social biases found in web corpora. In this work, we study data and models associated with multilabel object classification and visual semantic role labeling. We find that (a) datasets for these tasks contain significant gender bias and (b) models trained on these datasets further amplify existing bias. For example, the activity cooking is over 33% more likely to involve females than males in a training set, and a trained model further amplifies the disparity to 68% at test time. We propose to inject corpus-level constraints for calibrating existing structured prediction models and design an algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation for collective inference. Our method results in almost no performance loss for the underlying recognition task but decreases the magnitude of bias amplification by 47.5% and 40.5% for multilabel classification and visual semantic role labeling, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Determining the intended sense of words in text - word sense disambiguation (WSD) - is a long standing problem in natural language processing. Recently, researchers have shown promising results using word vectors extracted from a neural network language model as features in WSD algorithms. However, a simple average or concatenation of word vectors for each word in a text loses the sequential and syntactic information of the text. In this paper, we study WSD with a sequence learning neural net, LSTM, to better capture the sequential and syntactic patterns of the text. To alleviate the lack of training data in all-words WSD, we employ the same LSTM in a semi-supervised label propagation classifier. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results, especially on verbs.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a new task, visual sense disambiguation for verbs: given an image and a verb, assign the correct sense of the verb, i.e., the one that describes the action depicted in the image. Just as textual word sense disambiguation is useful for a wide range of NLP tasks, visual sense disambiguation can be useful for multimodal tasks such as image retrieval, image description, and text illustration. We introduce VerSe, a new dataset that augments existing multimodal datasets (COCO and TUHOI) with sense labels. We propose an unsupervised algorithm based on Lesk which performs visual sense disambiguation using textual, visual, or multimodal embeddings. We find that textual embeddings perform well when gold-standard textual annotations (object labels and image descriptions) are available, while multimodal embeddings perform well on unannotated images. We also verify our findings by using the textual and multimodal embeddings as features in a supervised setting and analyse the performance of visual sense disambiguation task. VerSe is made publicly available and can be downloaded at:},

@article{Pezeshki:2015aa,
	Abstract = {The Manual labeling of data is and will remain a costly endeavor. For this reason, semi-supervised learning remains a topic of practical importance. The recently proposed Ladder Network is one such approach that has proven to be very successful. In addition to the supervised objective, the Ladder Network also adds an unsupervised objective corresponding to the reconstruction costs of a stack of denoising autoencoders. Although the empirical results are impressive, the Ladder Network has many components intertwined, whose contributions are not obvious in such a complex architecture. In order to help elucidate and disentangle the different ingredients in the Ladder Network recipe, this paper presents an extensive experimental investigation of variants of the Ladder Network in which we replace or remove individual components to gain more insight into their relative importance. We find that all of the components are necessary for achieving optimal performance, but they do not contribute equally. For semi-supervised tasks, we conclude that the most important contribution is made by the lateral connection, followed by the application of noise, and finally the choice of what we refer to as the `combinator function' in the decoder path. We also find that as the number of labeled training examples increases, the lateral connections and reconstruction criterion become less important, with most of the improvement in generalization being due to the injection of noise in each layer. Furthermore, we present a new type of combinator function that outperforms the original design in both fully- and semi-supervised tasks, reducing record test error rates on Permutation-Invariant MNIST to 0.57% for the supervised setting, and to 0.97% and 1.0% for semi-supervised settings with 1000 and 100 labeled examples respectively.},

@article{Ioffe:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

	Abstract = {Suitable lateral connections between encoder and decoder are shown to allow higher layers of a denoising autoencoder (dAE) to focus on invariant representations. In regular autoencoders, detailed information needs to be carried through the highest layers but lateral connections from encoder to decoder relieve this pressure. It is shown that abstract invariant features can be translated to detailed reconstructions when invariant features are allowed to modulate the strength of the lateral connection. Three dAE structures with modulated and additive lateral connections, and without lateral connections were compared in experiments using real-world images. The experiments verify that adding modulated lateral connections to the model 1) improves the accuracy of the probability model for inputs, as measured by denoising performance; 2) results in representations whose degree of invariance grows faster towards the higher layers; and 3) supports the formation of diverse invariant poolings.},

	Abstract = {A network supporting deep unsupervised learning is presented. The network is an autoencoder with lateral shortcut connections from the encoder to decoder at each level of the hierarchy. The lateral shortcut connections allow the higher levels of the hierarchy to focus on abstract invariant features. While standard autoencoders are analogous to latent variable models with a single layer of stochastic variables, the proposed network is analogous to hierarchical latent variables models. Learning combines denoising autoencoder and denoising sources separation frameworks. Each layer of the network contributes to the cost function a term which measures the distance of the representations produced by the encoder and the decoder. Since training signals originate from all levels of the network, all layers can learn efficiently even in deep networks. The speedup offered by cost terms from higher levels of the hierarchy and the ability to learn invariant features are demonstrated in experiments.},

The effect of this hint, whether applied to back-propagation learning or to more general types of pattern associators is to reduce training time and improve generalization performance. A detailed vector field analysis of a hinted back-propagation network solving the XOR problem, shows that the hint is capable of eliminating pathological local minima. A set-theory/functional entropy analysis shows that the hint can be applied to any learning mechanism that has an internal (``hidden'') layer of processing. These analyses and tests conducted on a variety of problems using different types of networks demonstrate the potential of the hint as a method of controlling training in order to predictably train systems to effectively model data.},

	Abstract = {The support-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, variants of a neural network architecture for statistical language modeling have been proposed and successfully applied, e.g. in the language modeling component of speech recognizers. The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy.},

	Abstract = {The word2vec model and application by Mikolov et al. have attracted a great amount of attention in recent two years. The vector representations of words learned by word2vec models have been shown to carry semantic meanings and are useful in various NLP tasks. As an increasing number of researchers would like to experiment with word2vec or similar techniques, I notice that there lacks a material that comprehensively explains the parameter learning process of word embedding models in details, thus preventing researchers that are non-experts in neural networks from understanding the working mechanism of such models.},

	Abstract = {We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},

	Abstract = {We combine supervised learning with unsupervised learning in deep neural networks. The proposed model is trained to simultaneously minimize the sum of supervised and unsupervised cost functions by backpropagation, avoiding the need for layer-wise pre-training. Our work builds on the Ladder network proposed by Valpola (2015), which we extend by combining the model with supervision. We show that the resulting model reaches state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised MNIST and CIFAR-10 classification, in addition to permutation-invariant MNIST classification with all labels.},
